## Testing

### Browsers

When opening the site in the browsers Chrome, Firefox and Edge, they all showed lagging in opening up onto the landing page. All 3 browsers also showed a white edge on the right hand side of the screen indicating the width was wider than the large viewports as the scroll bar appeared at the bottom and not on the smaller screens.

When I created a mochup of the website on **Am I Responsive**, the **Navbar** on the mobile appeared on 2 lines, which happens when the screen is less than 300px.
